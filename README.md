# Codeshow-100days_of_code
100DaysOfCode is a challenge/community, where you publicly commit to code for 1 hour for the next 100 days.

# Rules
-In our version, of 100DaysOfCode, you need to do anything that helps you enhance your tech stack i.e. competitive coding, try learning a new language, read technical articles/ books, make open source contributions, add features to a personal project, etc.

-It's okay if you are not able to submit a pull request someday, you can resume it the next day, you will still be in the competition. Remember, life is not a sprint but a marathon, so is the path to learning and growning.

-Keep defining your short term goals (measurable) and strive hard to achieve them. (Eg. Getting better at competitive coding is not a measurable goal but achiving 2000 rating in Codechef is measurable.

-Update everyday progress and submit a pull request.

-(Optional) Follow 100DaysOfCode Twitter Bot that retweets the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag and timely tweet your progress with #100DaysOfCode hashtag.

-Try to add detailed description of what you did, add corresponding links, if you solve questions, you can add your codes in the same folder and provid a link in the README (not for active contests).

-We start the marathon on November 1, 2020. feel free to add your goals beforehand (they can also be added later).

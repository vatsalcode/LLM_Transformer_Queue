C++ Functions
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

Create a Function
C++ provides some pre-defined functions, such as main(), which is used to execute code. But you can also create your own functions to perform certain actions.

To create (often referred to as declare) a function, specify the name of the function, followed by parentheses ():

Syntax
void myFunction() {
  // code to be executed
}
Example Explained
myFunction() is the name of the function
void means that the function does not have a return value. You will learn more about return values later in the next chapter
inside the function (the body), add code that defines what the function should do
Call a Function
Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when they are called.

To call a function, write the function's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon ;

In the following example, myFunction() is used to print a text (the action), when it is called:

Example
Inside main, call myFunction():

// Create a function
void myFunction() {
  cout << "I just got executed!";
}

int main() {
  myFunction(); // call the function
  return 0;
}

// Outputs "I just got executed!"
A function can be called multiple times:

Example
void myFunction() {
  cout << "I just got executed!\n";
}

int main() {
  myFunction();
  myFunction();
  myFunction();
  return 0;
}

// I just got executed!
// I just got executed!
// I just got executed!
Function Declaration and Definition
A C++ function consist of two parts:

Declaration: the function's name, return type, and parameters (if any)
Definition: the body of the function (code to be executed)
void myFunction() { // declaration
  // the body of the function (definition)
}
Note: If a user-defined function, such as myFunction() is declared after the main() function, an error will occur. It is because C++ works from top to bottom; which means that if the function is not declared above main(), the program is unaware of it:

Example
int main() {
  myFunction();
  return 0;
}

void myFunction() {
  cout << "I just got executed!";
}

// Error
However, it is possible to separate the declaration and the definition of the function - for code optimization.

You will often see C++ programs that have function declaration above main(), and function definition below main(). This will make the code better organized and easier to read:

Example
// Function declaration
void myFunction();

// The main method
int main() {
  myFunction();  // call the function
  return 0;
}

// Function definition
void myFunction() {
  cout << "I just got executed!";
}

C++ Break and Continue
C++ Break
You have already seen the break statement used in an earlier chapter of this tutorial. It was used to "jump out" of a switch statement.

The break statement can also be used to jump out of a loop.

This example jumps out of the loop when i is equal to 4:

Example
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i == 4) {
    break;
  }
  cout << i << "\n";
}
C++ Continue
The continue statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.

This example skips the value of 4:

Example
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i == 4) {
    continue;
  }
  cout << i << "\n";
}

Break and Continue in While Loop
You can also use break and continue in while loops:

Break Example
int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  cout << i << "\n";
  i++;
  if (i == 4) {
    break;
  }
}
Continue Example
int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  if (i == 4) {
    i++;
    continue;
  }
  cout << i << "\n";
  i++;
}

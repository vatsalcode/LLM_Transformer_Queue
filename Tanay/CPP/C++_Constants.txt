C++ Constants
Constants
When you do not want others (or yourself) to override existing variable values, use the const keyword (this will declare the variable as "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only):

Example
const int myNum = 15;  // myNum will always be 15
myNum = 10;  // error: assignment of read-only variable 'myNum'
You should always declare the variable as constant when you have values that are unlikely to change:

Example
const int minutesPerHour = 60;
const float PI = 3.14;
